# ghidra-rs

A headless Rust reverse-engineering core that decodes machine code with Ghidra's compiled
SLEIGH specs (`.sla`). Milestone 1: load an ELF/PE/Mach-O x86-64 binary, disassemble it and
lift it to p-code. Milestone 2: function discovery on 32-bit x86 PE files, writing the same files
as the mercs2 project's Ghidra scripts ExportFunctions.java and ExportGaps.java. See `../DESIGN.md` for the scope and plan.

## Layout

- `ghidra-rs/src/sla.rs`: reader for the compressed packed `.sla` format (version 4).
- `ghidra-rs/src/sleigh.rs`: the SLEIGH decode engine: constructor matching, context, operand
  printing and p-code templates. It ports the runtime half of Ghidra's C++ sleigh
  (`Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/decompile/cpp`: sleigh.cc, slghsymbol.cc, slghpattern.cc,
  slghpatexpress.cc, context.cc, semantics.cc).
- `ghidra-rs/src/analysis.rs`: PE32 loading and Ghidra-style analysis: disassembly by recursive
  descent, function discovery, switch tables, function bodies, flows and data references.
- `ghidra-rs/src/scripts.rs`: writers for the ExportFunctions and ExportGaps CSV files, plus
  RTTI vftables and a small MSVC name demangler.
- `ghidra-rs/src/main.rs`: the `ghidra-rs` CLI (binary loading via the `object` crate).
- `ghidra-rs/tests/decode.rs`: decodes a fixed byte sequence and checks text and p-code.
- `ghidra-rs/tests/analysis.rs`: function discovery and both CSV writers on a fixed 32-bit blob.
- `build-sla.sh`: builds Ghidra's SLEIGH compiler and compiles `x86-64.sla` and `x86.sla`.
- `tools/sleigh_ref.cc`: a reference disassembler on Ghidra's C++ engine, printing in the
  same format, used to verify the Rust port.

## Build

Needs Rust (stable), and g++, make and zlib headers for the SLEIGH compiler.

```sh
cd rust
./build-sla.sh             # once, and again whenever the x86 .slaspec/.sinc files change
cargo build --release
cargo test --release
```

### The .sla file

`build-sla.sh` copies the C++ sources from `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/decompile/cpp`
into `rust/target/sleigh-build`, builds the `sleigh_opt` target there (using the checked-in
bison/flex outputs, so the upstream tree is not touched) and runs, for `x86-64` and `x86`:

```sh
sleigh_opt Ghidra/Processors/x86/data/languages/x86-64.slaspec \
           Ghidra/Processors/x86/data/languages/x86-64.sla
```

The output (about 500 KB each) lands where Ghidra itself keeps it. Upstream gitignores `*.sla`,
so it is not committed. The file is `"sla"`, a version byte (4), then a zlib stream holding
Ghidra's "packed" element/attribute encoding (`slaformat.cc`, `PackedDecode` in
`marshal.cc`).

`ghidra-rs` finds the `.sla` at that path by default (`x86.sla` for 32-bit binaries,
`x86-64.sla` otherwise). Override it with `--sla <file>` or the `GHIDRA_RS_SLA` environment
variable. The context defaults (`addrsize`, `opsize`, ...) come from the `<context_set>` of the
`.pspec` with the same name next to the `.sla`.

## Usage

```sh
ghidra-rs disasm <binary> [--func <symbol>|--addr <hex>] [--count N] [--pcode] [--sla <file>]
```

- `--func`: start at a symbol (static, dynamic or PE export; a leading `_` is optional for
  Mach-O) and, if the symbol has a size, stop at its end.
- `--addr`: start at a virtual address (hex, `0x` optional).
- Without either, it starts at the entry point.
- `--count`: maximum number of instructions (default 20, or the whole symbol with `--func`).
  The sweep also stops at the end of the containing section.
- `--pcode`: print the p-code ops under each instruction.

Output is `address  bytes  MNEMONIC operands` in Ghidra's spelling. Bytes Ghidra's spec
cannot decode print as `(bad: ...)`, and the sweep moves on one byte.

```
$ ghidra-rs disasm /usr/bin/ls --count 2 --pcode
0000000000005620  f3 0f 1e fa                    ENDBR64
0000000000005624  31 ed                          XOR EBP,EBP
    CF = COPY 0x0:1
    ...
```

Varnodes print as a register name when one matches exactly, `0x5:4` for constants and
`space[offset]:size` otherwise.

## Analysis (Milestone 2): the mercs2 Ghidra scripts

```sh
ghidra-rs analyze <pe32> [--functions <csv>] [--gaps <csv>]
                         [--seeds <csv> | --functions-from <csv>]... [--sla <file>]
```

Analyzes a 32-bit x86 PE and writes the files of two headless Ghidra scripts of the mercs2
decomp project (`mercs2-decomp/tools/ghidra`), in the same format:

| ghidra-rs flag | Ghidra script | file |
|---|---|---|
| `--functions` | `ExportFunctions.java` | `address,size,name,exported,fid,vtable_class,lua,callees,callers,data_refs`, one row per `.text` function |
| `--gaps` | `ExportGaps.java` | `address,size,class`: `.text` ranges outside every function body (`padding`, `table`, `unexamined`) |

It also prints the scripts' summary lines (`exported N functions`, `function coverage: N / M
.text bytes`). `CheckAbiCallers.java` is not covered yet.

The mercs2 pipeline does not run plain auto-analysis: after import it runs RecoverFunctions,
AuditRecoveredFunctions, FoldSlotFragments, AddRelocatedEntries and ClearFalseNoReturn
(`tools/ghidra/analysis_pipeline.sh`). ghidra-rs does not port those passes; it takes their
result as input instead:

- `--functions-from <csv>`: use exactly the functions in the first column of the CSV (any
  `0x`-prefixed address list, e.g. the pipeline's own `build/functions.csv`). Bodies, sizes,
  xrefs and gaps are still computed by ghidra-rs.
- `--seeds <csv>`: add these entries to what discovery finds.

Replacing the pipeline's export step (mercs2 paths):

```sh
ghidra-rs analyze orig/Mercenaries2.analysis.exe --functions-from build/functions.csv \
    --functions build/functions-analysis-folded.csv --gaps build/gaps-analysis-folded.csv
```

What discovery does, after Ghidra's analyzers:

- disassembles every executable section by recursive descent from the exports, the entry
  point and RTTI vftable slots (MSVC CompleteObjectLocator -> TypeDescriptor); call targets
  become functions;
- Function Start Search: the definite `x86win_patterns.xml` prologue pairs (`CC`/`90`/`C3`/
  `C9 C3`/`C2 nn 00` or `JMP` before a prologue) in bytes no code covers yet;
- switch tables `JMP [reg*4 + table]`, bounded by a preceding `CMP reg,imm` (else up to 1024
  entries while they point at code);
- Create Address Tables: runs of 2+ code pointers in data are disassembled, without making
  functions;
- Shared Return Calls with contiguous functions: an unconditional jump past the next function
  entry (or before the previous one) makes its target a function; such jumps count as calls
  for `callees`/`callers`;
- non-returning functions: known imports (ExitProcess, exit, abort, ...) and functions whose
  body has no return; calls to them end the flow;
- REP string instructions fall through (their p-code branches to themselves);
- data references: direct memory operands, and immediates that point into a non-executable
  section.

### Match against Ghidra (Mercenaries2.analysis.exe)

Compared on 2026-11-11 with the files the mercs2 pipeline produced with Ghidra (7.4 MB `.text`).
Column rates are over the functions both sides have.

| run | reference | functions | size | callees | callers | data_refs | gaps rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain discovery | `functions-analysis.csv` (import only, 23,323) | 22,388 common, 935 missing, 365 extra | 95.6% | 81.1% | 88.4% | 76.3% | (no reference) |
| `--functions-from functions-analysis-recovered.csv` | same file, `gaps-analysis.csv` | 39,782 of 39,785 | 97.6% | 88.7% | 94.7% | 80.8% | 38,974 of 39,773 identical |
| `--functions-from functions.csv` (folded) | same file, `gaps.csv` | 37,596 of 37,599 | 98.0% | 89.9% | 96.4% | 80.0% | 39,016 of 39,787 identical |

`name`, `exported`, `vtable_class` and `lua` match on 99.9% or more of the rows; `fid` is
always 0 (26 rows differ).

Known differences:

- Function ID (FID) is not implemented: `fid` is 0 and FID library names are missing.
- Indirect calls and memory operands that Ghidra resolves by constant propagation (`CALL EDX`
  after `MOV EDX,[vtable+n]`, `[ESI+n]` with known ESI) are not resolved: fewer `callees` and
  `data_refs`.
- Ghidra's non-returning heuristics differ: it treats some returning functions as
  non-returning (e.g. a 15-byte FSQRT wrapper at 0x401740 with 372 callers), which cuts the
  bodies of their callers short. ghidra-rs keeps those bodies (larger `size`).
- Function sets of plain discovery: Ghidra also creates functions from code pointers and
  operand references in some cases; making functions of all such pointers gave more extra
  functions than found ones, so ghidra-rs does not.
- The 3 functions missing with `--functions-from` (0x434544, 0x475541, 0x98248c) start inside
  an instruction that ghidra-rs decoded first from another flow (overlapping code); ghidra-rs
  keeps the first decode and drops the entry.

Time on the same machine: ghidra-rs `analyze` takes about 9.5 s wall (8.3 s analysis, one
thread). Ghidra's auto-analysis of the same game (`Mercenaries2.exe`, mercs2
`build/ghidra-import.log`) took 723 s, before the post-scripts.

## Speed

Measured on 2026-11-11 with a release build on a 12-thread machine (one thread used). The
input was the whole `.text` of `/usr/lib/libLLVM.so.21.1`: 97 MB, 21,830,419 instructions,
with output sent to `/dev/null`:

| run | time | instructions/s |
|---|---|---|
| `ghidra-rs disasm` | 20.7 s | about 1.05 M |
| `ghidra-rs disasm --pcode` | 82.6 s | about 264 K |
| C++ `sleigh_ref` (Ghidra's engine, text only) | 19.1 s | about 1.14 M |

## Limits

- One processor family: x86 (`x86-64.sla` and the 32-bit `x86.sla`). `analyze` takes 32-bit
  PE files only.
- Context starts from the `.pspec` defaults. Context commits (`globalset`) are recorded per
  address in the `Parse` and apply to later decodes there (flowing ones from that address on);
  the x86 specs do not use them. Delay slots, `crossbuild`, `inst_next2` and flowref/flowdest
  are not implemented.

## Verifying against the C++ engine

`tools/sleigh_ref.cc` disassembles a raw code file with Ghidra's own C++ engine and prints
in the same format as `ghidra-rs disasm` (bytes column aside). To build it:

```sh
cd rust
make -C target/sleigh-build -o xml.cc -o pcodeparse.cc -o slghparse.cc -o slghparse.hh -o slghscan.cc libsla.a
g++ -O2 -std=c++11 -Itarget/sleigh-build tools/sleigh_ref.cc target/sleigh-build/libsla.a -lz -o target/sleigh_ref
```

To compare the `.text` section of a binary:

```sh
start=$(objdump -h BIN | awk '$2==".text"{print $4}')
objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text BIN /tmp/text.raw
target/sleigh_ref ../Ghidra/Processors/x86/data/languages/x86-64.sla /tmp/text.raw $start pcode > ref.txt
target/release/ghidra-rs disasm BIN --addr $start --count 1000000000 --pcode \
  | sed -E 's/^([0-9a-f]{16})  ([0-9a-f]{2} ?)+ +/\1  /; s/^([0-9a-f]{16})  \(bad.*/\1  (bad)/; s/    <no p-code.*/    <no p-code>/' > rs.txt
diff rs.txt ref.txt
```

Results on 2026-11-11 (text and p-code identical in every case):

| binary | instructions | differing lines |
|---|---|---|
| /usr/bin/ls | 25,109 | 0 (with p-code) |
| /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.3 | 845,611 | 0 (with p-code) |
| /usr/lib/libLLVM.so.21.1 | 21,830,419 | 0 (text only) |

`sleigh_ref` uses the 64-bit context defaults for a `.sla` whose path contains `x86-64`, and
the 32-bit ones of `x86.pspec` (`addrsize=1`, `opsize=1`) otherwise. `ghidra-rs disasm` picks
`x86.sla` by itself for a 32-bit binary.

Results on 2026-11-11 with context read from the `.pspec` (Milestone 2):

| binary | sla | instructions | differing lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| /usr/bin/ls | x86-64 | 25,109 | 0 (with p-code) |
| mercs2 `Mercenaries2.analysis.exe` `.text` (linear sweep) | x86 | 2,470,185 | 4 (with p-code) |

The 4 lines are one 19-byte run of `SS` prefixes at 0xa5ddfe, longer than x86's 15-byte
limit: its displacement lies past the 16-byte instruction buffer, where the C++ engine reads
past the end of its array and ghidra-rs reads zeros.
